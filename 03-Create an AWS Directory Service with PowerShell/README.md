## Learning Objectives

* The AWS Management Console can sometimes abstract away implementation details that are important to APIs
* We will need an AWS Directory Service to handle user authentication from Amazon WorkSpaces
* Use the `AWS.Tools.DirectoryService` module in PowerShell to create an AWS Directory Service
* Simple AD, Active Directory, or AD Connector will work fine, however AD Connector requires extra setup work

* Register AWS Directory Service with Amazon WorkSpaces
